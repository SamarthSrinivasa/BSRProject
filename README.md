## BSRProject
BSR-Project-AmrLab-DSpath

Project Description: 
The primary objective of the BSR project is to establish a standard set of benchmark datasets for evaluating and comparing the performance of spatial regionalization algorithms. By providing diverse datasets and comprehensive evaluations, this project aims to contribute to the development of more effective and efficient spatial regionalization techniques.


Project Tasks:
The following tasks will be performed in order as time permits, completing all of the tasks is recommended. However, we will adjust based on the time schedule.


Data Collection: Gather a rich and diverse set of spatial datasets from various sources, including US census data and data from other countries where spatial polygon data is available. Consider different combinations of variables, such as population density, income levels, and land-use types.
\
\
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the datasets to ensure consistency and compatibility with various spatial regionalization algorithms.
\
\
Algorithm Selection: Identify and implement a range of spatial regionalization algorithms for evaluation and comparison from the existing techniques in the literature.
\
\
Benchmarking: Run the selected spatial regionalization algorithms on the compiled benchmark datasets and record their performance in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and other relevant metrics.
\
\
Analysis and Comparison: Analyze the results and compare the performance of different spatial regionalization algorithms across the benchmark datasets. Identify trends, strengths, and weaknesses, and suggest potential improvements for the algorithms.
\
\
Documentation: Prepare a detailed report and presentation summarizing the project's findings and contributions to the spatial regionalization research community.
